This directory holds all the infrastructure necessary to run the simulation.

Important Files:

--> "m200/launch_m200_attack.sh" - script used to launch the robot in
    simulation. Random initialization

--> "m200/meta_m200.bhv" - behavior file script for the robot. Controls which
    bheavior occurs and how they switch. Currently hardwired with the launch
    script such that it always is in BHV_Input mode.

--> "m200/meta_m200.moos" - moos file for the the robot. Controls which
    processes are running in the MOOSDB and what variables get shared. 

--> "shoreside/meta_shoreside.moos" - moos file for shoreside. Controls which
    processes are running on shoreside and which variables get shared out.

Directory Structure:

--> "m200/" - holds relevant files to launching and simulating the robots

--> "shoreside/" - holds all relevant files to launching and simulating the
    shoreside

--> "mokai/" - holds relevant files to simulating motorized kayaks, very
    similar to robot directory in terms of contents

--> "plug_*" files - files that are called by the .moos files for vehicles
    and shoreside that control specific processes
